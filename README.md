# EE314-Term-Project
In this project, we were asked to design and implement a basic Quality of Service (QoS) network on FPGA using Verilog. There are 4 buffers each data can go through. A reading is made from these buffer contents according to an algorithm that obeys a predefined latency and reliability precedence requirement. The input data is a 4-bt sequence where first two bits indicate which buffer it belongs to and the last two bits indicate its content. Also, we display the whole process on a VGA screen. More detailed information can be found in the term project report.
